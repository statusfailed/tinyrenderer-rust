# The tinyrenderer course in Rust

The [tinyrenderer](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer) course (or "How OpenGL Works"),
implemented in the Rust language.

These are my solutions to working through the exercises on the project's wiki.

NOTE: I am learning rust while I write this. The code is reaaaally bad! There
are potential panics everywhere- lots of TODOs to tidy up uses of unwrap(),
etc. Don't judge meeee!
